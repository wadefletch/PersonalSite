      I previously created <a href="//covintern.com">CovIntern</a>, a platform
      that helped 120k+ students find remote internships during the COVID-19
      pandemic. I also spent a year at{' '}
      <a href="//atentocapital.com">a venture fund</a>, mostly working on
      sourcing. I graduated from Indiana University with degrees in Computer
      Science and Finance. I currently live in Seattle, WA, though I was born
      and raised in South Carolina.
