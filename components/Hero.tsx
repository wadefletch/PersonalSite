    <p>
      I lead Engineering at an <a href="//atmos.ai">ESG software startup</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I previously created <a href="//covintern.com">CovIntern</a>, a platform
      that helped students find remote internships during the COVID-19 pandemic.
      I also spent a year at a venture fund, mostly working on sourcing. I
      graduated from Indiana University with degrees in Computer Science and
      Finance. I&apos;m currently based in Seattle, WA, though I was born and
      raised in South Carolina.
    </p>

    <p>
      I&apos;m interested in AI, building technical teams, early-stage
      investing, and the intersection of technology and finance.
