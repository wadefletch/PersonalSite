      <p>
        I&apos;m a co-founder of <a href="//tractorbeam.ai">Tractorbeam AI</a>,
        building the reasoning and memory layer for AI applications. I&apos;m
        also a software engineer with experience at the earliest stages of
        startups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most recently, I was the first engineer at{' '}
        <a href="//atmos.ai" className="underline">
          Atmos AI
        </a>
        , building TurboTax for ESG reporting. (In 2024, Atmos was acquired by{' '}
        <a href="//wapsustainability.com">an ESG consulting firm</a>.) I also
        created <a href="//covintern.com">CovIntern</a>, a platform that helped
        120k+ students find high-quality remote internships during the COVID-19
        pandemic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m interested in AI, scaling technical teams, early-stage
        investing, and the intersection of technology and finance.
