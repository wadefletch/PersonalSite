      <p>
        I&apos;m an independent AI researcher and software engineer, working on
        building scalable retrieval systems for LLMs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most recently, I was the founding engineer (and then CTO) at{' '}
        <a href="//atmos.ai">Atmos AI</a>, building TurboTax for ESG reporting.
        In 2024, Atmos was acquired by{' '}
        <a href="//wapsustainability.com">a large ESG consulting firm</a>. I
        also created <a href="//covintern.com">CovIntern</a>, a platform that
        helped 120k+ students find remote internships during the COVID-19
        pandemic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m interested in AI, scaling technical teams, early-stage
        investing, and the intersection of technology and finance.
